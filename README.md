# Overseas UK Student Loan Repayments

> I took out a loan to study in the UK for university and now live/work overseas. How much will I have to pay back this year?

The shiny app hosted [link here] answers the above question, as a means to a) plan your payments for the upcoming year, and b) fact-check correspondence between yourself and [Student Loans Company](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/student-loans-company) (SLC).

## Details

The data used in the app is based entirely on the official tables for overseas income thresholds on the gov.uk site, respectively for [Plan 1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-earnings-thresholds-for-plan-1-student-loans/overseas-earnings-thresholds-for-plan-1-student-loans-2020-21), [Plan 2](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-earnings-thresholds-for-plan-2-student-loans/overseas-earnings-thresholds-for-plan-2-student-loans-2020-21) and [Postgraduate](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-earnings-thresholds-for-postgraduate-student-loans/overseas-earnings-thresholds-for-postgraduate-student-loans-2020-21) loans. If you do not know which plan you are on, you can read the [relevant page](https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/which-repayment-plan-you-are-on) or [log in](https://www.gov.uk/sign-in-to-manage-your-student-loan-balance) to your account.

## Is it worth making additional repayments?

There are already well developed calculators aimed at answering this, see for example [here](https://www.student-loan-calculator.co.uk/) and [here](https://yourslrc.co.uk/). You may take your income (converted to GBP by the current app), and supply it to one of these calculators along with your current debt balance to get your own assessment.
